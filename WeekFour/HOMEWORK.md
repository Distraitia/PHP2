# Week 4 homework

1. Abstract the users route to a controller using different methods. You must have methods for:

    - Creating a new user: /users/create
    - Updating a user: /users/update
    - Deleting a user: /users/delete
    - Show the users: /users

You can hardcode the values of whatever user you are creating/updating/deleting.

2. Create a register and login page

3. Create a dummy "secured" page but not accessible yet

    - A basic page that returns hello world

4. Modify default.blade.php to your template. Make it look pretty, but it doesnt have to look badass.
